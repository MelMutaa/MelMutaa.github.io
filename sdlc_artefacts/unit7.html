            <h2>What is Ontology?</h2>
            <p>
                Ontology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, or reality. In the context of information systems, ontology refers to a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. It provides a shared vocabulary for researchers and practitioners to model a specific domain, allowing machines and humans to understand and exchange information effectively (Gruber, 1993). Ontologies are used in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, and information science, to define and categorize data, aiding in data sharing, integration, and reasoning.
            </p>
            <p>
                As defined by Studer, Benjamins, and Fensel (1998), ontology is "an explicit specification of a conceptualization," meaning that it formalizes the description of objects, concepts, and relationships within a particular area of interest in a way that can be processed by machines. Ontologies are crucial in enabling semantic interoperability between systems, allowing different systems to communicate using a common understanding of the domain.
            </p>

            <h2>Ontology in This Week’s Reading</h2>
            <p>
                The ontology presented in this week's reading likely refers to a specific domain model or framework, designed to organize and structure the information relevant to that domain. For example, if the reading was focused on a healthcare information system, the ontology would map out the relationships between different medical concepts, such as patients, diseases, treatments, and healthcare providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the reading, it’s evident that ontologies help to simplify complex systems by providing a structured way of understanding the relationships between entities. This formal structure enables better communication, data integration, and decision-making within the system.
            </p>

            <h2>Defining an Ontology Relevant to the System for the Summative Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                For the system being designed in your summative assessment, let’s assume you are building an e-commerce platform. An ontology for this system could define key entities and their relationships, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Products:</strong> Entities representing the goods or services sold on the platform, with properties like price, category, description, and availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Individuals or entities purchasing products, with attributes like name, email, shipping address, and purchase history.</li>
                <li><strong>Orders:</strong> Transactions that link customers to products, containing information like order date, payment status, shipping status, and total cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Payments:</strong> The method by which orders are paid, including properties like payment type (credit card, PayPal, etc.), transaction ID, and payment status.</li>
                <li><strong>Suppliers:</strong> Entities that provide products to the platform, with attributes such as company name, product range, and contact details.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews:</strong> Feedback provided by customers on products, including rating, comments, and review date.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This ontology would allow your e-commerce platform to structure and categorize data effectively, improving data retrieval, user interaction, and system integration with other services. By formalizing these concepts and their relationships, you provide a shared understanding for both developers and users, enabling more efficient design and implementation.
            </p>
