            <h2>Is Faceted Data a Good Approach to Protect Systems from Data Leakage?</h2>
            <p>
                Faceted data, as described by Schmitz et al. (2016), is a method of organizing and managing data by dividing it into multiple dimensions, or "facets," each representing a different aspect of the data. The goal of faceted data is to enable more granular control over data access and to help mitigate the risks of data leakage.
            </p>
            <h3>Pros of Faceted Data Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Granular Access Control:</strong> Faceted data allows organizations to enforce fine-grained access control by restricting access to specific facets based on user roles or privileges, reducing accidental data leakage (Schmitz et al., 2016).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Isolation:</strong> Breaking down data into facets makes it easier to isolate sensitive information from less sensitive data, complicating attackers' access to the entire dataset in the event of a breach.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Faceted systems can scale well, with facets being independently managed and protected, enhancing flexibility in securing large datasets across distributed systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance with Privacy Regulations:</strong> Faceted data supports compliance with regulations like GDPR by restricting access to personal or sensitive data facets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons of Faceted Data Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex Implementation:</strong> Faceted data systems introduce complexity in managing access controls and ensuring consistent protection, raising development and maintenance costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> Querying multiple facets and enforcing access controls can create performance issues, especially for real-time systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Attack Surface:</strong> The complexity introduced by multiple facets could expand the attack surface, with vulnerabilities potentially arising in the access control mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outline Design for a Faceted Data System in Python</h2>
            <p>Below is a basic outline of how a faceted data protection system could be designed in Python.</p>

            <h3>1. Data Structure:</h3>
            <p>We can represent the faceted data in a dictionary, where each facet contains key-value pairs representing different types of information.</p>

            <p>
            # Faceted Data Structure Example <br>
            faceted_data = {<br>
                "public_info": {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"},<br>
                "financial_info": {"credit_card": "**** **** **** 1234", "balance": 1000},<br>
                "personal_info": {"address": "123 Main St", "phone": "123-456-7890"},<br>
                "sensitive_info": {"social_security_number": "123-45-6789"},<br>
            }<br>
            </p>

            <h3>2. Access Control:</h3>
            <p>Roles will be defined to control which facets are accessible to which users.</p>

            <p>
            # Role-based access control <br>
            roles_permissions = {<br>
                "admin": ["public_info", "financial_info", "personal_info", "sensitive_info"],<br>
                "user": ["public_info", "financial_info"],<br>
                "guest": ["public_info"]<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            def check_access(role, facet):<br>
                """Check if a role has access to a given data facet"""<br>
                return facet in roles_permissions.get(role, [])<br>
            </p>

            <h3>3. Faceted Data Retrieval:</h3>
            <p>The system checks the user’s role before granting access to a facet of the data.</p>

            <p>
            def get_facet_data(user_role, facet):<br>
                """Retrieve facet data if user role has access to the facet"""<br>
                if check_access(user_role, facet):<br>
                    return faceted_data.get(facet, "Facet not found")<br>
                else:<br>
                    return "Access Denied"<br>
            <br>
            # Example usage <br>
            user_role = "user"<br>
            requested_facet = "sensitive_info"<br>
            print(get_facet_data(user_role, requested_facet))  # Output: Access Denied<br>
            </p>

            <h3>4. Logging and Auditing:</h3>
            <p>Logs can be maintained to track access attempts, aiding in identifying potential data leaks.</p>

            <p>
            def log_access(user_role, facet, result):<br>
                """Log access attempts"""<br>
                with open("access_log.txt", "a") as log_file:<br>
                    log_file.write(f"Role: {user_role}, Facet: {facet}, Result: {result}\n")<br>
            <br>
            # Log the access attempt <br>
            result = get_facet_data(user_role, requested_facet)<br>
            log_access(user_role, requested_facet, result)<br>
            </p>

            <h3>5. Encryption of Facets:</h3>
            <p>Each facet can be encrypted separately using a key management system, providing an additional layer of security.</p>

            <p>
            from cryptography.fernet import Fernet<br>
            <br>
            # Generate a key for encryption<br>
            key = Fernet.generate_key()<br>
            cipher_suite = Fernet(key)<br>
            <br>
            # Example of encrypting sensitive data facet<br>
            encrypted_data = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"123-45-6789")<br>
            faceted_data["sensitive_info"]["social_security_number"] = encrypted_data<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                While faceted data offers an effective approach to controlling access and isolating sensitive data, it introduces complexity and potential performance overheads. By implementing access control, encryption, and logging in a Python-based system, security can be enhanced, but careful consideration must be given to the system's scalability and potential vulnerabilities.
