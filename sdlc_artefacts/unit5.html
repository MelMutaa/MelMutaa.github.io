            <h2>Should Cyclomatic Complexity be considered today in code design?</h2>
            <p>
                Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) remains valuable in understanding code complexity and maintainability, though it should not be the only metric used to gauge code quality. Its relevance is seen in a few key areas:
            </p>
            <p><strong>1. Testing and Maintainability:</strong> Cyclomatic Complexity helps determine how much testing is needed for software by counting the number of independent execution paths. High CC values suggest more testing is needed to ensure all possible paths are covered, improving code robustness (McCabe, 1976).</p>
            <p><strong>2. Maintainability:</strong> Code with high CC is often difficult to modify or extend without introducing errors. Lowering complexity through refactoring makes software easier to maintain, aligning with modern practices that emphasize clean, simple code (McCabe, 1976).</p>
            <p>However, some argue that the importance of CC has decreased due to modern software development practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong> With modern testing frameworks, writing comprehensive test suites to cover all possible paths is more automated. Thus, CC becomes less crucial in determining test coverage (Prather, 2020).</li>
                <li><strong>Declarative and Functional Programming:</strong> In languages that emphasize declarative or functional styles (e.g., Haskell, Scala), CC might not adequately reflect actual code complexity since control flow is often implicit rather than explicit (Prather, 2020).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Is Cyclomatic Complexity relevant in developing secure software?</h2>
            <p>In the context of secure software development, Cyclomatic Complexity’s relevance is nuanced.</p>
            <h3>Arguments for Relevance:</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Reducing Attack Surface:</strong> Higher code complexity often correlates with a greater likelihood of bugs or vulnerabilities, as complex code is harder to test and reason about. Reducing complexity through lower CC scores can help decrease the attack surface, making vulnerabilities easier to detect (SANS Institute, 2020).</p>
            <p><strong>2. Control Flow Complexity:</strong> Many security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and input validation errors, often occur in highly complex control flows. Cyclomatic Complexity can act as an early indicator of areas that require closer scrutiny to ensure they are secure (Larson, 2018).</p>

            <h3>Arguments Against Relevance:</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Security-Specific Issues:</strong> Cyclomatic Complexity does not address security-specific concerns such as data flow integrity, secure encryption, or proper handling of authentication and authorisation processes. Code with low CC could still have critical security flaws if these aspects are ignored (SANS Institute, 2020).</p>
            <p><strong>2. Modern Security Tools:</strong> Today, static analysis tools and automated vulnerability scanners are far more effective in identifying specific security risks compared to CC, which is more focused on control flow and logic (Weidman, n.d.).</p>

            <h2>Conclusion and Personal Opinion</h2>
            <p>
                Cyclomatic Complexity still plays a role in understanding and managing code complexity, which can indirectly support secure software development by highlighting areas of the code that require more attention during testing. However, in modern development, particularly when prioritizing security, CC is not as essential as other tools and methods specifically designed to identify vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my view, CC should be considered alongside other metrics, particularly in traditional procedural or object-oriented codebases where control flow is paramount. However, in environments where declarative or functional programming dominates, or where automated testing and security tools are heavily relied upon, its relevance is diminished. For secure software development, it is better to pair CC with security-focused practices such as static analysis, threat modelling, and secure coding standards.
            </p>
