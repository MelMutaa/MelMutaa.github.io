            <h1>Managing the Human Factor in Cybersecurity: Overcoming Insider Threats</h1>

        <!-- Description Section -->
        <div class="artefact-description">
            <p>
                People are often cited as the biggest risk in cybersecurity. Whether through negligence, lack of awareness, or malicious intent, employees can unintentionally or deliberately open the doors to cyberattacks. ISO/IEC 27000 Standard, Section 3 on terms and definitions, provides a foundation for understanding how organisations can manage their people to mitigate these risks. Here are five key terms from the standard that can help address insider threats:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Information Security (3.28)</strong><br>
                This refers to the protection of information from unauthorised access, modification, or destruction. Employees must be trained in best practices to maintain information security, such as using strong passwords, recognising phishing emails, and safeguarding sensitive data. Continuous education and awareness programs can drastically reduce unintentional security breaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. Confidentiality (3.10)</strong><br>
                Protecting the confidentiality of data ensures that only authorised personnel have access to sensitive information. Role-based access control (RBAC) helps limit exposure, ensuring that employees only access data essential to their job functions. By managing access levels carefully, organisations can minimise the risk of data leaks from within.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. Risk Management (3.49)</strong><br>
                Risk management involves identifying and mitigating potential threats, including those posed by insiders. Organisations should regularly assess the risk of insider threats, including disgruntled employees or those vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Implementing security measures like multi-factor authentication and real-time monitoring can help manage these risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Incident (3.36)</strong><br>
                Cybersecurity incidents often involve human error, such as clicking on malicious links. Establishing clear incident response protocols, including who to contact and how to contain the breach, ensures that employees can act quickly to minimise damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. Security Policy (3.54)</strong><br>
                A well-documented security policy provides guidelines for acceptable behaviour regarding the use of information systems. Clear communication of these policies, along with regular updates, reinforces a security-first mindset within the organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                By managing people through education, access control, risk assessment, incident response, and strong security policies, organisations can significantly reduce the risk of insider-caused cyberattacks. Management should not leave anything to chance.
