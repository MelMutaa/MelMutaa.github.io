            <p>
                Over the course of the module, I had the opportunity to work as part of a development team to design and implement a secure retail application. The project involved creating an online retail system with secure and insecure modes individually. Within the team, tasks were divided based on our strengths and preferences to produce the design proposal. The teamwork process involved regular communication, role allocation, and collaborative decision-making, which helped us progress toward our project goals.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Analysis of Contribution and Process:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1. Work Allocation and Team Roles:</strong> One of the key challenges we faced was ensuring clear task allocation. Initially, there was some confusion due to a few team members not attending seminar sessions, which led to conflicting ideas about how to execute the design proposal. This proved to be difficult, as miscommunication about responsibilities slowed progress. We sought guidance from our tutor, which helped clarify the requirements and aligned the team’s focus. After overcoming this hurdle, we refined the task allocation process, assigning responsibilities based on individual preferences and expertise, which significantly improved workflow.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Leadership and Coordination:</strong> I took on the role of team leader, which included finalising the design proposal document and ensuring the team's output was cohesive. My responsibilities included compiling the final submission, checking in with team members to address any blockers they encountered, formatting the document, and ensuring that references were properly cited.</p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Experience of Different Roles:</strong> This hands-on experience provided me with a deeper understanding of the full software development lifecycle and how different roles contribute to the project’s success. This exposure helped me see the importance of creating secure and readable code from the start, rather than treating security as an afterthought. It also highlighted the need for attention to detail and how crucial peer reviews are in identifying potential bugs and vulnerabilities before they reach production.</p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Team Meetings and Collaboration:</strong> The team meetings played a crucial role in ensuring that we stayed aligned on project objectives. However, not all meetings were equally effective. Early on, we lacked a clear agenda and spent too much time discussing small issues, which hindered our productivity. Learning from this, we adopted a more structured approach for meetings. Regular communication through platforms like WhatsApp helped reduce misunderstandings and kept everyone updated on task progress.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Learning and Development Process:</strong> This module was also an opportunity to improve my understanding of the software development process, particularly from a security perspective. I gained a lot of practical knowledge by implementing secure protocols and mitigating vulnerabilities like cryptographic failures.</p>

            <br><p><strong>Actionable Steps and Future Applications:</strong></p>

            <p><strong> Improving Early Role Allocation:</strong> In future projects, I will ensure that roles and responsibilities are discussed and clarified at the very beginning. I will also encourage the team to use collaborative tools like Trello early on, to ensure task allocation is visible and clear to everyone.</p>
            
            <p><strong> Building Communication Skills:</strong> Effective communication is crucial, especially in remote teams. I plan to develop my communication skills by setting clearer expectations for meeting agendas and regular updates on task progress, ensuring objectives are completed without rushing.</p>
            
            <p><strong> Testing:</strong> One of the major takeaways from this project was the need for continuous testing and validation of security features. Going forward, I plan to adopt a more robust testing methodology from the start, including security-focused tests and regular code reviews to avoid overlooking potential weaknesses.</p>
            
            <p><strong> Cross-functional Collaboration:</strong> Taking on different roles in the project allowed me to see the importance of cross-functional skills in a development team. I will continue to work on improving my abilities beyond my immediate role to contribute more effectively across the development cycle.</p>
            
            <p><strong> Continuous Reflection:</strong> Reflecting throughout the project helped me identify and resolve problems quickly. I plan to make continuous reflection a habit by using project journals or reflection tools to document critical incidents and areas for improvement.</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br> Overall, this module provided me with invaluable insights into both the technical and collaborative aspects of software development. As I pursue my career, I will aim to balance my technical responsibilities with proactive collaboration and mentorship, especially with team members less familiar with certain aspects of the project.</p>

            <p>
                Throughout the module, I actively participated in the discussion forums, contributing to conversations around key security concepts and development methodologies. Key contributions included:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Cryptographic Failures Discussion:</strong> I analysed the importance of strong encryption algorithms and secure key management, referencing OWASP’s guidelines and discussing real-world cryptographic failures such as poor hashing algorithms. This contribution helped the team prioritise upgrading password hashing to stronger algorithms (e.g., bcrypt instead of MD5).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. Security Requirements Analysis:</strong> In several forum discussions, I advocated for a clear focus on compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR. I emphasised the importance of encrypting sensitive personal data, which informed the final decision to focus encryption efforts on critical fields in the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. OWASP Top 10 Application:</strong> I contributed to discussions about mitigating SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities, proposing specific coding practices such as input validation and parameterised queries. This helped guide the team’s implementation of secure database interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Final Reflections</strong><br>
                In reflecting on the development process, several key lessons emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prioritisation and Scope Management:</strong> The project highlighted the importance of prioritising essential features and being flexible with secondary features when time and resources are limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication and Collaboration:</strong> Active participation in forums and team meetings allowed for the exchange of ideas that strengthened the final implementation. The emphasis on shared security principles helped ensure the software met core objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Assumptions made in Unit 6 about the ease of implementing certain features had to be adjusted as technical complexities arose. This required the team to adapt the original plan to ensure we could still deliver a secure and functional system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, while the final project did not perfectly match the initial design from Unit 6, the changes made were justified by the need to balance security, practicality, and the available resources.

                    <div class="artefact-description">

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            The final project delivered in Unit 11 reflects the core goals laid out in the design proposal from Unit 6, but there were some differences in the implementation due to evolving requirements and practical constraints encountered during development. This evaluation highlights these differences and provides justifications for the changes and omissions made during the process.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Software vs. Specification</h4>
                        <p>
                            The design proposal in Unit 6 detailed the development of a secure web application that adhered to cryptographic standards, used the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, and addressed vulnerabilities such as cryptographic failures. The project was meant to include features such as secure user authentication, data encryption, and role-based access control.
                        <br><br><b>In the final project:</b>
                        </p>

                        
                        <ul> 
                            <li><b>Core functionality </b>  was simplified. Instead of encrypting all data fields as planned, encryption was applied only to sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, personal identifiable information). This change was justified by the need to balance performance and security while still adhering to core encryption requirements.</li>
                            <li><b>Role-based access control </b> which was proposed in Unit 6, was omitted due to time constraints. Although 2FA is an important security feature, its implementation was deprioritized to focus on other critical features.</li>
                            <li><b>Core functionality </b> was implemented with AES encryption, as originally planned. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4><br><br>However, some features were omitted or modified due to time constraints and technical challenges:</h4>

                        <ul> 
                            <li><b>Database-level encryption  </b> (e.g., user authentication, encryption) was successfully implemented.</li>
                            <li><b>Two-factor authentication (2FA) </b> was included as specified, using granular permissions for different user types.</li>
                            <li><b>Logging and </b> were more basic than originally planned. The Unit 6 design proposed detailed audit logs of all user actions, but the final implementation had a simpler logging mechanism focused on login attempts and data access. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <br><br><h4>Justifications for Changes and Omissions</h4>

                        <p> •	<b>Time and Resource Constraints:</b> The most significant factor leading to omissions, like the exclusion of 2FA and simplified logging, was time. The scope of the original design was ambitious, and implementing all features to a high standard within the given timeline proved challenging. <br><br>
                            •	<b>Technical Feasibility:</b> Some proposed features (like full-database encryption) presented technical challenges that required a reconsideration of the design. Encrypting every field in the database would have introduced significant complexity and potential performance bottlenecks, so we opted for a selective encryption strategy that balanced security with practicality. <br><br>
                            •	<b>Focus on Key Security Features:</b> We prioritised implementing security-critical features like secure authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and access control. This decision was made to ensure the software still met its core objectives related to security and compliance, even if some non-essential features had to be delayed or simplified. <br><br>
                            </p>

                    <h4>Data and Requirements Analysis</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        In Unit 6, we gathered requirements for the system, focusing on: <br><br>

                            1. <b>Security: </b> The most significant factor leading to omissions, like the exclusion of 2FA and simplified logging, was time. The scope of the original design was ambitious, and implementing all features to a high standard within the given timeline proved challenging. <br><br>
                            2. <b>User Access Control:</b> Defining roles for different user types (e.g., admin, user, guest) and implementing permissions based on these roles. <br><br>
                            3. <b>Compliance:</b> Ensuring the system adhered to data protection regulations such as GDPR by encrypting sensitive user data and logging access attempts.<br><br>
                            <b>Our assumptions included:</b><br><br>

                            •	The user base would be familiar with basic authentication mechanisms (e.g., username and password). <br><br>
                            •	There would be limited scalability requirements, meaning we focused on securing a medium-sized application.<br><br>
                            •	User roles would be relatively simple (admin, user, guest) without the need for highly complex hierarchical access controls.<br><br>

                            These requirements were largely met in the final project. However, assumptions about time and complexity led to a revaluation of the features. For example, we initially assumed that implementing 2FA would be straightforward, but when balancing it against more critical security needs, we realised it was too resource-intensive for the scope of the project.
